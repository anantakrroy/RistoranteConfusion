# RistoranteConfusion
This webpage is part of the exercise of *Coursera* ***Full stack Web Development*** course. As a beginner, started out with basic HTML and CSS. As a gradual progression to the course, got introduced to the wonderful capabilities of **Bootstrap** and used it extensively to style the webpage. As part of the third course in the *6-part specialisation* , will be using **Angular JS** framework to bring about some dynamic changes in the **MENU** page
